F# Workshop
==============

##Introduction##
**Do you want to learn F# and Functional Programming?** Well, you better start coding!

Learning a new programming language is not easy, on top of reading a lot you need to practice even more.

This workshop is designed to teach you some of the basics of F# and Functional Programming by combining theory ([slides](https://github.com/jorgef/fsharpworkshop/raw/master/FSharpWorkshop_Slides.pdf)) and practice ([exercises](https://github.com/jorgef/fsharpworkshop/raw/master/FSharpWorkshop_Exercises.pdf)).

## Modules ##

The course is split into 5 modules, each of them contains a presentation (theory) and one exercise (practice). You can find exercises for each module in this document, for the presentation and source code, refer to the section 
 

### Module 1 ###
- Bindings
- Functions

- Records

### Module 2 ###
- High order functions
- Pipelining
- Partial application
- Composition

### Module 3 ###
- Options
- Pattern matching
- Discriminated unions
- Units of measure

### Module 4 ###

## Recommended Learning Material ##

Choose the material by selecting the sentence that fits you best. It is recommended to review the first two before taking the workshop.

#### I don’t understand why people are talking so much about functional programming ####

Watch this video: [Functional Programming: What? Why? When?](https://vimeo.com/97514630) by Robert C. Martin [@unclebobmartin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin)

#### I haven’t written F# before or I don’t remember much ####

Practice Online: [Try F#](http://www.tryfsharp.org)

#### I need an intro to F# for C# developers ####

Watch this video: [F# for the C# developer](http://youtu.be/H0pS5UnVa2E) by Mathias Brandewinder [@brandewinder](https://twitter.com/brandewinder)

#### I want to play around with F# without writing much code ####

Practice using the Tutorial project in Visual Studio:

- Add New Project -> Other Languages -> Visual F# -> Tutorial
- View -> Other Windows -> F# Interactive
- Open Tutorial.fsx
- Highlight the code you want to execute and then right-click “Execute in Interactive” (Alt+Enter)

#### I want to read a good book to learn Functional Programming and F# ####
